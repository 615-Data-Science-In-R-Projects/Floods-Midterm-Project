## Introduction

## Data Cleaning

```{r}
#Reading in the data from NOAA
storms<- read.csv("StormEvents_details_2021.csv")

#Filtering so that we only look at storms:
floods_raw<- storms |> filter(str_detect(EVENT_TYPE,"Flood")==TRUE)

```
 So immediately, a few things stand out: the way the dates are coded and the fact that they're coded twice and differently. 
 What I'll shoot for here is to have dates as month, day and time and also as a single datetime
 
```{r}
#floods_date_time<- floods_raw |> select(-c(BEGIN_YEARMONTH,BEGIN_DAY,BEGIN_TIME,
                                          # END_YEARMONTH,END_DAY,END_TIME))

#What's the best way to clean time here? I might leave it till the EDA to see what makes it easiest there

floods_date_time<- floods_date_time |> mutate(BEGIN_MONTH=)

#What will need to be done is to make all the times the same timezone using a series of ifelse statements
```
 
After dates, the damages columns need fixing.
